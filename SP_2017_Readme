Useful:

Correlation Plots
TC_FW (goes with the files: temp_cor56.ascii and temp_cor56_largeL.ascii)
E_background (why 'electron_background' seems to be a poor estimate)
NK_2 (Various plots for all nuclear tests)
NK_3 (Particle rates etc. agains time around nuclear tests marked by black vertical line)
TemporalCorHIST (goes with temp_cor56.ascii)




NOT so useful:

BDAY_3d_plot
EQS (first idea for TC_FW)
NK_1
Particle bursts- full script (first version of temporal analysis)
